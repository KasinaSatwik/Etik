/**
 * @fileoverview Install a leaky WeakMap emulation on platforms that
 * don't provide a built-in one.
 *
 * <p>Assumes that an ES5 platform where, if {@code WeakMap} is
 * already present, then it conforms to the anticipated ES6
 * specification. To run this file on an ES5 or almost ES5
 * implementation where the {@code WeakMap} specification does not
 * quite conform, run <code>repairES5.js</code> first.
 *
 * <p>Even though WeakMapModule is not global, the linter thinks it
 * is, which is why it is in the overrides list below.
 *
 * <p>NOTE: Before using this WeakMap emulation in a non-SES
 * environment, see the note below about hiddenRecord.

/**
 * This {@code WeakMap} emulation is observably equivalent to the
 * ES-Harmony WeakMap, but with leakier garbage collection properties.
 *
 * <p>As with true WeakMaps, in this emulation, a key does not
 * retain maps indexed by that key and (crucially) a map does not
 * retain the keys it indexes. A map by itself also does not retain
 * the values associated with that map.
 *
 * <p>However, the values associated with a key in some map are
 * retained so long as that key is retained and those associations are
 * not overridden. For example, when used to support membranes, all
 * values exported from a given membrane will live for the lifetime
 * they would have had in the absence of an interposed membrane. Even
 * when the membrane is revoked, all objects that would have been
 * reachable in the absence of revocation will still be reachable, as
 * far as the GC can tell, even though they will no longer be relev
